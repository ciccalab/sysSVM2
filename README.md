# sysSVM2-NN

## Description
sysSMV2-NN is a computational tool for patient-specific cancer driver gene prioritisation. It is based on the principle that driver genes are characterised by particular molecular properties (*e.g.* mutations, copy number variants) and systems-level properties (*e.g.* evolutionary origin, breadth of expression). It works by identifying genes with similar properties to canonical drivers.
\
The first part of the method (sysSVM2) requires a cohort of cancer samples. There are four broad steps to the algorithm: 
1. Feature mapping:
1. Model selection:
1. Training:
1. Prediction:
\
The second part of the method uses a Neural Network (NN) to incorporate additional training samples to expand the initial sysSVM2 model.  

## Download/installation
I guess it needs to be a package?


## Running sysSVM2 on an initial cohort
Run ```some code.R```


## Expanding a cohort with sysSVM2-NN
Run ```some code.py```


## Reference
Need to publish first lol
